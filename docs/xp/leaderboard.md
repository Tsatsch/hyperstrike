# Leaderboard

The leaderboard displays your ranking among other traders based on your XP points.

![Leaderboard Example](placeholder-leaderboard.png)

## How It Works

When you have enough points, you'll appear in the leaderboard showing:
- Your **.hl name** (if available)
- Your **Name** from the .hl record (when key-value pair with key = "name" is set)
- Your **Icon/Avatar** from the .hl record (when key-value pair with key = "avatar" is set and value is a valid HTTPS-URL)
- Your **additional data**: Any other key-value pairs (not "name" or "avatar") will be displayed when users click on your profile in the leaderboard

## Key-Value Pairs

### Displayed Information
- **name**: Your display name in the leaderboard
- **avatar**: Your profile icon/avatar (must be a valid HTTPS URL)

### Additional Data
Any other key-value pairs (not "name" or "avatar") will be displayed when users click on your profile in the leaderboard.
